In a flexible learning environment, being fluent in multiple subjects is crucial. The focus should be on closing the 
gap between former and  current
 knowledge. Frankly, I am 
fond of the 
generous
 spirit
 of my teachers, whose 
generosity in sharing knowledge fuels my goal of becoming a graduate.

As an 
undergraduate
, I 
frequently
 
encountered
 
challenges
, but I was 
able
 to 
handle
 them with the help of my 
mentors
. The 
forecast
 for my 
academic
 
success
 was 
uncertain
, yet I was 
determined
 to 
achieve
 
glory
. The 
glorious
 
moment
 of 
graduation
 was a 
testament
 to my 
hard
 work and the 
support
 of my 
informal
 study groups.

Now, as a 
postgraduate
, I am 
even
 more 
grateful
 for the 
opportunities
 that have come my way. I 
guarantee
 that the 
harvest
 of 
knowledge
 I have 
gained
 will not be 
harmful
 but 
beneficial
. The 
frequent
 
interactions
 with my 
peers
 and 
professors
 have been a 
harm
 to 
none
, only 
enriching
 our 
academic
 
experience
.
