## 文章

- In a flexible learning environment, proficiency in a range of subjects is key. The emphasis should be on bridging the gap between past and present knowledge. To be candid, I hold a deep appreciation for the benevolent spirit of my educators, whose openhandedness in imparting knowledge propels my ambition to become a graduate.
- As an undergraduate, I often faced obstacles, but I managed to overcome them with the guidance of my mentors. The outlook for my academic achievements was unpredictable, yet I remained resolute in my pursuit of excellence. The triumphant moment of graduation stood as a testament to my perseverance and the backing of my informal study groups.
- Now, as a postgraduate, I am even more appreciative of the chances that have presented themselves. I assure you that the knowledge I have acquired will be advantageous, not detrimental. The regular interactions with my fellow students and faculty have harmed no one; instead, they have only enriched our academic journey.
